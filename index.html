<h2>üõ†Ô∏è Data Preparation in Excel</h2>

<p><strong>1. Importing Data:</strong><br>
The raw dataset was reviewed in Excel to understand its structure, identify irrelevant columns, and set appropriate data types‚Äîespecially date formats.</p>

<p><strong>2. Data Cleaning:</strong></p>

<p><strong>Steps included:</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Removing duplicates:</strong> No duplicates were found.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Standardizing data:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Minor standardization like trimming spaces (<code>=TRIM</code>) or correcting capitalizations (<code>=PROPER</code> or <code>=UPPER</code>).</li>
      <li>Filters were used to check consistency in names and terms.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Handling missing values:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Used <code>XLOOKUP</code> or manual filters to address missing data.</li>
      <li>Filled missing Grades using the <em>Sub_Grade</em> column.</li>
      <li>Estimated missing Interest Rates from similar rows.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  
  <li><strong>Removing irrelevant Columns/Rows:</strong> Columns not relevant to the analysis were removed to simplify the dataset.</li>
  
  <li><strong>Adding new columns:</strong>
    <p>Created a Loan Quality Label based on the loan status:</p>
    <pre><code>=IF(OR([@[Loan_Status]]="Fully Paid", [@[Loan_Status]]="Current"), "Good Loan", IF([@[Loan_Status]]="Charged Off", "Bad Loan", ""))</code></pre>
  </li>
</ol>

  <h2>üìä Pivot Tables for Key Metrics</h2>
  <p>Before building the dashboard, key performance indicators (KPIs) were defined and summarized using PivotTables with proper formatting (%, currency, thousands/millions).</p>
  <p><strong>Key Metrics include:</strong> Total Loan Amount, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Average Interest Rate, Debt-to-Income Ratio (Good vs. Bad loans), Loan Counts by Employee, State, and Purpose, and Monthly Trends.</p>

  <h2>üìà Dashboard Development</h2>

  <p><strong>Design Principles:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>Focused on executive-level KPIs</li>
    <li>Clean and intuitive layout</li>
    <li>Interactive filters for data exploration</li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>Visual Elements:</strong></p>
  <ul>
    <li>KPI Cards: Total Loan, Funded Amount, Amount Received, Avg. Interest Rate</li>
    <li>Doughnut Charts: Good vs. Bad Loans, Loan Terms</li>
    <li>Bar Charts: Loans by Employee Experience, Loan Purpose</li>
    <li>Line Charts: Monthly Trends</li>
    <li>Map Charts: Geographic Loan Distribution</li>
    <li>Filters: Risk Grade, Loan Purpose</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚úÖ Key Insights from the Dashboard</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>The majority of loans are <strong>Good</strong>, with only <strong>16% charged off</strong>. Though the causes for charge-offs are unknown, this is an area worth investigating.</li>
    <li><strong>28% of high-risk grade loans (E, F, G)</strong> were charged off, compared to only <strong>13% for low-risk grades (A, B, C)</strong>.</li>
    <li><strong>75% of all loans (10.6k out of 14.4k)</strong> belong to low-risk categories.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="center">
    <img src="Images/Risky_loans.png" alt="Risky loans" width="450">
  </div>

  <ul>
    <li>Loan issuance increases throughout the year, peaking toward the end.</li>
    <li>Most loans are concentrated in <strong>California, Texas, Florida,</strong> and <strong>New York</strong>.</li>
    <li>The majority of loans are for <strong>debt consolidation</strong>, followed by <strong>credit card repayment</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>üîç Opportunities for Further Analysis</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Trend analysis on interest rates over time</li>
    <li>Correlation between interest rates and risk grades</li>
    <li>Performance evaluation by employee experience</li>
    <li>Relationships between loan amount, interest rate, grade, and repayment status</li>
    <li>Identifying factors contributing to charged-off loans</li>
  </ul>
